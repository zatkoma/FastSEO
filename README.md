This plugin could help you makes your SEO routine/tasks faster. :) There are all source codes that are in Chrome Extension Market, so if you want to make your version because you use different tools, you can fork and work on them. If you have a tip which tool can I add to Fast SEO, please send an Issue or Pull request. 

I'm searching for tools, which are used, which could be some "small" tools like GTMetrix, PageSpeed, or "big" tools that have all SEOs like Ahrefs. 

In the future, I plan to add setting tab and add work with more tools that you could set up them. 

## In-house SEO

If you are doing in-house SEO, you probably have some things in your CMS or platform where you could be fast. So you can fork this repo and make customization for your case and your company.

## Thanks for using :)
